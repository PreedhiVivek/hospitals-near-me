This web app lets you find out highest overall rated hospitals within in 20-mile radius your zip code. This web application works only if you live in the USA. 

# Background

Apparently all US hospitals that accept publicly insured patients (in the US, they call it Medicaid and Medicare) have to submit data about their quality of care to a body known as the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/). Most hospitals seem to accept publicly insured patients ... so the data that someone compiled and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is quite comprehensive.
